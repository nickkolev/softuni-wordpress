# softuni-wordpress
This is a repository for the Wordpress for Developers course at SoftUni.

This website is a simple restaurant page. 

Unfortunately i have to be abroad from 1st of February to 9th of February. This is why I am uploading the project early. It is barely covering the requirements because of that fact, but the important thing is that I have understood how Wordpress works under the hood. 

Should be continued after the exam on 10th of February...
